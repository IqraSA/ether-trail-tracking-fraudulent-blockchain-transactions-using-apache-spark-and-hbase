# Ether Trail - Tracking Fraudulent Transactions Using Apache Spark
A proof of concept application that uses Apache Spark to crunch the Ethereum 
transaction data to find absurd transactions and the trail of those transactions based on the 
senderâ€™s Ethereum wallet address submitted through a user query. Also, compared the performance and 
speedup for hash and shuffle join and joins using HBase for finding interesting structures in the given graph problem.
